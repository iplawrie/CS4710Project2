Questions:
1. "Another abstraction concern is regarding agent IDs, nonces and keys. In real-world systems, 
these are all multi-bit numbers. However, to keep the state space small and to simplify our model,
we model them as ‘mtype’. We model encrypted messages as a user-defined data type that includes three
fields, all of type ‘’mtype’. These fields respectively represent a key, and two other pieces of
data, each one of them being anything such as nonce or ID."
  What does this mean? What types are we supposed to be using and what are we passing?

2. How do we structure the channel?

3. Are we sending a "message" message, or not?

4. Why is Alice sending her ID?
